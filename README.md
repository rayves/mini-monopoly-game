## Planning
### Elements

1. Board
2. Players
3. Dice

#### Board

##### Spaces - 9

Spaces will be imported from external json file

**Attributes**
1. name
2. price
3. colour
4. type: property
5. ownership status

All attributes except for ownership cannot be changed.

###### GO - 1

1. Will be space 0 (starting space)
2. provides players with $1 every time they pass "GO" (wrap around the board)
3. Does not have a price
4. Does not have a colour
5. type: "go"
6. Cannot be purchased
7. Does not deduct money from players

###### Properties - 8

1. Can be purchased by players
2. Deducts rent equal to the price if a player that does not own the property land on it (player's current space = property space)
3. Rent doubles if a player owns all the properties of the same colour for that specific colour

#### players - 4

**Attributes**
1. name (cannot be changed)
2. can hold and earn currency
3. can hold and buy properties
4. current space
5. player status - playing or bankrupt

#### dice
1. 1-6 possibilities
2. rolls will be predetermined for this project 
3. rolls will be imported from external json file

### App components/features

#### Set up components

##### generate players
1. players will be an array of player names
2. create a player object (new class object instance) for each player in array and store all players within a variable

##### generate board
1. import board json file and parse so data is readable in app
2. store this data as variable called board
3. board should be an array of hashes each hash object representing a space on the board
4. generate a new class object instance for each hash objects within the board array using its attributes as initialized values and store this as a variable called spaces. Spaces should be an array of space object instances.

##### generate rolls
1. import rolls json and parse so data is readable in app
2. store data as a variable called rolls

##### link the rolls to the player
1. define variable index as value 0
2. loop through each element of rolls array
3. through each iteration define a hash of player at index value 'index' with value equal to roll value and push that hash into new array called player_rolls
4. player_rolls should be an array of hashes with each hash value being the roll value and each key being the player that rolled that roll value.
5. the order of the players will depend on where they are placed within the array of players.

##### Player components

###### Player Position

The board consists of position 0 - 8, being 9 spaces.

1. players initialize with current_space of 0
2. a player's new position will be determined by adding the player's roll to their current space (i.e. current space 0 and roll 4 equals new position of 4 on the board)
3. when the sum of a player's current position and their roll exceed the total number of spaces on the board, the player's new position will be 0 (starting the board again) **plus** the sum of player's current position and their roll **minus** the total number of spaces on the board.
   i.e. current position 4 + roll of 6 = current position of
   0 + (10 - 9) = **1**
4. once new position determined, the player's current position will the reassigned to the new position.

###### Player Wallets

1. players initialize with a wallet with $16 each
2. wallet will increase by rent received
3. wallet will decrease by rent paid or purchase of properties

###### Owned Properties

1. players initialize with no properties
2. when a player lands on an unowned property they must buy it if they have enough money
3. once the property is purchased it is added into array which will keep track of the player's properties

###### Paying or Receiving Rent/Purchasing properties

1. if a player lands on an owned property, they must pay the player that owns the property rent
3. if a player lands on an unowned property space they must purchase that property
5. if a player does not have enough money in their wallet to purchase the unowned property nothing will happen (wallet < property price)
6. if a player does not have enough money to pay rent to the property owner they will bankrupt (wallet < property rent) (see keeping track of player bankruptcy status)

###### Checking property colours

1. a property's rent will be multiplied by either 1 or 2 depending on whether the property owner player owns all the properties of the matching colour.
2. when a player lands on an owned property they don't own, all the properties of the player that owns the property will be looped through and compared against the current property colour.
3. matches will be counted in a variable
4. if the variable is greater than 1, the rent of the current space property will multiplied by 2 else 1.

###### Bankruptcy Status

1. all players start with a status of 'playing'
2. once a player bankrupts, the player's status will be reassigned to 'bankrupt
3. the game ends with the first player to bankrupt

##### Property components (spaces with attribute property)

###### Keeping track of owner

1. All properties initialize with an owner attribute of 'Unowned'
2. when a property is purchased, the owner attribute is reassigned to the player object that purchased the property, creating a link between the player object and the property.

## Game Results

Based on the given data:
1. board.json
2. rolls_1.json
3. rolls_2.json
4. Player order as follows
   1. Peter
   2. Billy
   3. Charlotte
   4. Sweedal

**Game 1**
- Peter finished on Massizim with $39
- Billy finished on GO with $14
- Charlotte finished on Gami Chicken with $0
- Sweedal finished on Gami Chicken with $1

**Peter is the winner!**

**Game 2**
- Peter finished on Lanzhou Beef Noodle with $5
- Billy finished on Fast Kebabs with $20
- Charlotte finished on GO with $29
- Sweedal finished on Massizim with $0

**Charlotte is the winner!**
